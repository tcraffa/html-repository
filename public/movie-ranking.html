    <h1>The Best Movies According to Thomas</h1>
    <h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>
    <hr />
    <h3>Lawrence of Arabia</h3>
    <p>
      Peter O'Toole is one of my favorite actors. And the cinematography in this
      movie is spectacular. If you like hsitorical epics, you will love this
      movie.

    <h3>Star Wars Episode 4: A New Hope</h3>
    <p>
      The original. The one that started one of the biggest franchises in
      history. Enough said.
    </p>
    <h3>The Shawshank Redemption</h3>
    <p>
      The premise of this story is simple. Man is unjustly accused of his wife's
      murder, he goes to jail, and now he needs to figure out a way to convince
      someone of his innocence. But this is just the beginning. The storyline is
      powerful and moving. And, believe it or not, the original story was
      written by Steven King. Not what you would normally expect from King, but
      brilliant just the same.
